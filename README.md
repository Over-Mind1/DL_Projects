# Deep Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Projects** repository! This is a centralized hub where I publish and maintain my deep learning work across different domains including medical imaging, signal processing, and more.

---

## Repository Structure

Each project has its own folder with:

- Source code  
- Jupyter notebooks  
- `requirements.txt`  
- README with explanation and usage

---

## Projects

### ✅ CNN_HEPATO_Model (Done)

A Convolutional Neural Network for classifying Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) using CT and MRI scans.  
**Tech**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV  
**Features**: Custom CNN, image pre-processing, training visualization.

---

### ✅ ecg_signal_DL (Done)

Deep learning model for classifying ECG signals to detect anomalies like arrhythmias.  
**Tech**: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, signal filtering  
**Features**: ECG preprocessing, time-series classification, evaluation metrics.

---

## Upcoming Projects (Coming Soon)

### ⏳ Audio Classification (Wheezes & Crackles)

Spectrogram-based CNN model to detect respiratory sounds.  
**Expected**: Signal transformation, CNN architecture, deployment-ready output.

### ⏳ Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

Comparing Faster R-CNN with ResNet vs MobileNet backbones for detecting objects in real time.

## How to Run

```bash
cd project_folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook  # or run the main script
```

Use a virtual environment for better dependency management:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
